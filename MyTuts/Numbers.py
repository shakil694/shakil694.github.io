# NOTE: This tutorial is based for Python 3

# In this example we would see some operations that can be performed
# on Python data type: Numbers

# Numbers: int, float, etc etc. (Don't worry! You don't have to learn these many types!)

myNumber = 12  			# Int type assignment 

myNumberFloat = 12.12	# Float type assignment

# Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
# 			  exponentiation, negation

myNumber1 = 10

myNumber2 = 20

# Addition ('+' operator is used)
result = myNumber1 + myNumber2
print('Addition is:',result)			# Print the result

#Subtraction ('-' operator is used)
result = myNumber2 - myNumber1
print('Subtraction is:',result)

#Multiplication ('*' operator is used)
result = myNumber1 * myNumber2
print('Multiplication is:', result)

# For integer type division ('//' operator is used)
result = myNumber2 // myNumber1
print('Int Division is:',result)

# For floating type division ('/' operator is used)
result = myNumber2 / myNumber1
print('Floating type Division is:',result)

# For exponentiation (power of ('**'operator is used))
result = myNumber1 ** myNumber2
print('Result is:',result)

print('HAPPY CODING!')
